# Glox â€” A Lox Interpreter in Gleam

- Glox is an implementation of the Lox language (from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)) written in Gleam.
- We target javascript to run it in the browser.
  - We use [lustre](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/index.html)
- Some examples of Lox code are [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/01e6f5b8f3e5dfa65674c2f9cf4700d73ab41cf8/test/scanning)
